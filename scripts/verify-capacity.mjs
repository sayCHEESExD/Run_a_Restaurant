/**
 * Room capacity, checked against a RUNNING server.
 *
 * The other two suites are static: they read the course data and exercise the
 * services in-process. This one cannot be, because what it is checking is the
 * matchmaker - the thing that decides which room a connecting player lands in,
 * and which only exists once a server is actually listening.
 *
 * It connects more clients than one room may hold and asserts three things:
 *
 *   - no room ever holds more than `MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM`
 *   - the overflow is ROUTED to another room rather than refused
 *   - every room CLOSES ITSELF once its last player leaves
 *
 * All three matter. A limit that turned the sixteenth player away would be a
 * limit that closes the game to them; a limit that let them in anyway would
 * not be a limit at all; and a room that outlived its last player would leak a
 * simulation loop apiece on a server that has been up for a week.
 *
 * Usage: start the server, then `npm run verify:capacity`.
 *        ENDPOINT=wss://your-host npm run verify:capacity  to check a deployment.
