 *
 * The fallback only guesses for LOCAL development, where the dev script really
 * does put the game server on the next port along. It deliberately does NOT
 * guess for a deployed origin: Netlify and every other static host serve files
 * and nothing else, so `wss://the-site/:2569` is an address that cannot ever
 * answer - and a client pointed at one spends thirty seconds timing out
 * instead of saying what is actually wrong.
 *
 * So a deployed build with no `VITE_SERVER_URL` returns an empty string, and
 * the boot path reports a misconfiguration rather than a network failure.

 * `https://name.fly.dev`, that is what gets pasted in, and a Colyseus client
 * given an `https://` origin fails with a message about the socket rather than
 * about the scheme. Converting is unambiguous, so it is done rather than
