 * which turns the camera, which redefines what "forward" means - the classic
 * feedback loop where the movement keys end up steering the view.
 *
 * The simulation rotates its stick input by `yaw`, so the camera is the single
 * source of "which way is forward" and the robot's facing follows where it is
 * actually going.
 *
 * At speed it pulls back and widens. Late game runs at hundreds of units a
 * second, and a fixed camera makes the next gap arrive with no warning - the
 * dynamic framing is what buys the reaction time the obby needs.
