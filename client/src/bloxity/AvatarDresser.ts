 * shared by the local player and every remote one: a player who looks one way
 * on their own screen and another way on everybody else's is the bug this
 * whole feature exists to remove, and two code paths is how that happens.
 *
 * The split of work is what keeps a re-dress cheap:
 *
 *  - the BODY is rebuilt only when a body PART changes, because that is the
 *    only thing that changes its geometry;
 *  - the skin, the hat, the back item and the proportions are applied to
 *    whatever body is currently mounted, and cost no rebuild at all.
 *
 * So the common case - somebody changes hat mid-run - re-parents one mesh.
