 * Builds a rider out of a player's Bloxity avatar.

 * The body is Bloxity's `player.glb`, and the body PARTS are geometry swapped
 * onto its skeleton - which is how Bloxity's own renderer does it, and the only
 * way it can be done: a part is authored as a skinned mesh against that one
 * shared rig, so it has no meaning except as a replacement for the mesh it
 * stands in for.
 *
 * What makes this safe to drop into this game is that Bloxity's rig and
 * `player.fbx`'s rig are THE SAME RIG. The GLB carries the twelve bone names
 * `PlayerRig` binds, so the whole procedural animation system - gait phase,
 * posting bob, the straddle - drives a Bloxity body without knowing it is one.
 * Nothing here writes a bone rotation, and nothing here animates.
 *
 * Everything is cached by URL, so ten players in the same hat cost one hat.
