/**
 * PROFILE KEYS: what a player's progress is filed under.
 *
 * Two kinds, and the boundary between them is the whole point of this file.
 *
 *   - A GUEST is keyed by the id their browser generated (`p_...`). It lives
 *     in that browser's localStorage and in no other.
 *   - An ACCOUNT is keyed by `bloxity:<accountId>`, where the account id is
 *     the `_id` Bloxity's own API returned for the player's game token. It
 *     follows them to every browser and device.
 *
 * The prefix is RESERVED. A browser id that starts with it is refused
 * outright, because otherwise a guest could name themselves into somebody's
 * account by pasting the right string into localStorage. The client never
 * sends an account id at all - only the token - and the server never trusts
 * one it did not get from Bloxity.
