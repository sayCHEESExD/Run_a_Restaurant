# The Colyseus server, for Bloxity Hosting.
#
# Built from the REPOSITORY ROOT, not from `server/`. This is an npm workspaces
# monorepo and the server imports `@restaurant/shared` as a workspace dependency;
# a build context of `server/` alone has no `shared/` to resolve it against and
# no root lockfile to install from.
#
#   docker build -t run-a-restaurant-server .
#   docker run -e PORT=2820 -p 2820:2820 run-a-restaurant-server

# The manifests first, so a change to game code does not re-run the install.
# Every workspace's package.json is needed: npm resolves the whole tree at once
# and fails on a workspace it cannot find. `.npmrc` comes too, so the image
# installs with exactly the npm settings CI and a laptop use.

# The full install, dev dependencies included - TypeScript is a devDependency
# and there is nothing to compile without it.
RUN npm ci

COPY server/ server/

# Builds `shared` first and then the server, which is the order the server's
# imports require: `@restaurant/shared` resolves to `shared/dist/index.js`.
RUN npm run build:server

# Drop to production dependencies in place. This keeps the workspace symlinks
# that `@restaurant/shared` resolves through - deleting node_modules and
# reinstalling per-workspace would break them.

# the port unreachable from outside it, which looks exactly like a crashed

# per its docs) - and `serverConfig` falls back to 2820 when it is unset.

# WHERE PROGRESS LIVES. On Bloxity Legion every pod is injected with
# `MONGODB_URI` - an isolated managed database per game and channel - and the
# server keeps every profile and every purchase there, one document per key.
# Progress survives restarts, scale-to-zero and deploys; nothing on the pod's
# own disk matters.
#
# /data is the JSON DEV STORE, used only when `MONGODB_URI` is unset (a
# laptop, the verification scripts). A `profiles.json` left here beside a
# Mongo deployment is imported on boot, insert-only, then ignored.
