/**
 * THE ROOM LIST Bloxity's store page reads for its "Servers" panel:
 * `GET /api/coly-matchmaker/all-rooms?mode=<id>`, pointed at by the catalogue
 * row's `allRoomsUrl`
 * (`https://<hosting id>.host.bloxity.io/api/coly-matchmaker/all-rooms?mode=0`).
 *
 * The body is the shape the portal already parses:
 *
 *   { rooms: [{ region, id, type, players, maxPlayers, locked, metadata }],
 *     servers: ['bloxity'], onlineServers: ['bloxity'],
 *     totalPlayers, totalRooms, timestamp, version, mode }
 *
 * `region` is always "bloxity": Legion has one cluster of interchangeable
 * pods, but the portal renders the field per row, so it cannot be left out.
 *
 * WHERE THE ROOMS COME FROM MATTERS. `matchMaker.query()` sees only the pod
 * that answered this request, so on a fleet of N pods it reports about 1/N of
 * the game - and `totalPlayers` feeds the platform's health board. The list
 * must come from the matchmaker's CROSS-POD directory whenever one exists
 * (`MATCHMAKER_REPORT_URL` is set in a Legion deployment); the local process is
 * the source ONLY when it is not (local development, a single-process host).
 * A directory that cannot be read answers 502 with no online servers rather
 * than a quietly partial list.
 *
 * Only public listings are published - the same set any client reads from the
 * lobby - so the token is optional: enforced only if `LEGION_GETROOMS_API_TOKEN`
 * happens to be set.
