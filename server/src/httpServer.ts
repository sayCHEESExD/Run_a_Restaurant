 * It ANSWERS EVEN WHEN THE DATABASE IS DOWN. Legion restarts a pod whose
 * probe fails, and a restart does not bring a database back; what it does is
 * drop every player who was mid-run. The outage is reported in the body and
 * in the log, and joins fail cleanly in the room instead.

 * that moved ahead of a deploy than an attack, and which a refund would turn
 * into a purchase the player made and lost. A retried webhook for a known
 * transaction is a 200 too, and pays out nothing more.
 *
 * It replies 401 only when a configured secret does not match, 400 only when
 * the body is not something that can be recorded at all, and 503 when the
 * database cannot take the record - the one case where Bloxity SHOULD retry,
